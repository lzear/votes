> Implementation of some
> [electoral systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system)

## üßë‚Äçüíª Install

```sh
yarn add votes
```

## üó≥Ô∏è Use

```typescript
import { utils as voteUtils, VotingSystem } from 'votes'

const scores = scoresFromBallots(
  [
    { ranking: [['Lion'], ['Bear'], ['Sheep']], weight: 4 },
    { ranking: [['Sheep'], ['Bear'], ['Lion']], weight: 3 },
    { ranking: [['Bear', 'Sheep'], ['Lion']], weight: 2 },
  ],
  ['Lion', 'Bear', 'Sheep'],
  VotingSystem.Schulze,
)
// -> { Lion: 0, Bear: 2, Sheep: 1 }

const ranking = scoresToRanking({ Bear: 2, Lion: 0, Sheep: 1 })
// -> [ [ 'Bear' ], [ 'Sheep' ], [ 'Lion' ] ]
```

## üìä Voting systems

See
[Comparison of electoral systems (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_electoral_systems)
for more information.

**‚ö†Ô∏èMaximal lotteries & Randomized Condorcet‚ö†Ô∏è** (Errors included): Returns
probabilities for each candidate that should be used for a lottery between the
Candidates. If a candidate is the Condorcet winner, its probability will be 1.
Despite being non-deterministic, those methods are the fairest.

**Ranked pairs**: Using the duel results as edges, build an acyclic graph
starting by the strongest score differences. The roots of the graph are the
winners.

**Schulze method**: From the votes, compute the results of all possible duels.
Then remove the most indecisive (closest to 50/50) duels until there is an
undefeated candidate, the winner. This popular voting system is used by several
organizations (Ubuntu, Debian, Wikimedia...).

**Kemeny‚ÄìYoung method**: A relatively complex computation generating a
preference order aiming to minimize dissatisfaction of the voters. Also known as
Kemeny rule, VoteFair popularity ranking, the maximum likelihood method, and the
median relation.

**Minimax Condorcet method**: Ranking the candidates by smallest pairwise
defeat.

**Copeland's method**: Rank candidates by number of duels won against other
candidates.

**Approval voting**: Each voter can select (‚Äúapprove‚Äù) any number of candidates.
The winner is the most-approved candidate.

**Borda count**: For each voter, every candidate is given a number of points
which equals the number of candidates ranked lower in the voter's preference.

**Nanson method**: Iterative Borda count in which, each round, candidates
scoring the average score or less are eliminated.

**Baldwin method**: Iterative Borda count in which, each round, candidates
scoring the lowest score are eliminated.

**Instant-runoff**: Considering only the top choice of each voter, the candidate
with the fewest votes is eliminated. The election repeats until there is a
winner. This voting system is very similar to single transferable vote method.

**Coombs' method**: Each round, the candidate with the most last rank is
eliminated. The election repeats until there is a winner.

**Contingent vote** (immediate **Two-round system**): If no candidate receives
50% of the votes in the first round, then a second round of voting is held with
only the top two candidates.

**Plurality**: Simple voting method where only the preferred candidate of each
voter gets 1 point. AKA first-past-the-post.
